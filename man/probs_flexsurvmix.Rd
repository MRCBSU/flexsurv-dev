\title{Probabilities of competing events from a flexsurvmix model}
\usage{
probs_flexsurvmix(x, newdata = NULL, B = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Fitted model object returned from \code{\link{flexsurvmix}}.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame or list of covariate values.}

\item{B}{Number of simulations to use to compute 95\% confidence intervals,
based on the asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of the basic
parameter estimates.  If \code{B=NULL} then intervals are not computed.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the probability that each of the competing
  events will occur next, by event and by any covariate values specified in
  \code{newdata}.
}
