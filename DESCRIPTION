Description: Flexible parametric models for time-to-event data,
    including the Royston-Parmar spline model, generalized gamma and
    generalized F distributions.  Any user-defined parametric
    distribution can be fitted, given at least an R function defining
    the probability density or hazard. There are also tools for
    fitting and predicting from fully parametric multi-state models.
